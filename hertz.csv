2020-05-03 20:08:33,ShhhWNBAIsOn,1588532913,self.wallstreetbets,,92,1,"CAR reported it’s revenue for April was down 80% from same time last year. I imagine once we see HTZ earnings they will fall between 65-75%, not quite as high as CAR. 

HTZ is a big player in the airport segment but also has replacement business at their local levels propping them up, where CAR is pretty much strictly limited to corporate and retail business. That’s why I think they will get hit harder with negative growth. 

However, HTZ is in big trouble due to missed lease payments on April 27. They have until tomorrow to come up with a way to pay. Unfortunately, they can’t just sell the cars because every dealership across the nation is closed and buyer demand is gone. They have no way to offload their inventory. They are heavily considering filing for bankruptcy after hiring corporate restructuring consultants. 

I know you’re thinking they have fallen quite a bit and all this is already priced in after CAR reported it’s earnings. But, if you look at CAR guidance, they think they are going to get even harder in the coming months even with reopenings in place. Along with this, Buffet announced he pulled out of airlines, I think we see these stocks follow another decline with the the airlines as they rely on the airport business to stay afloat. 

If you have driven past any of these companies local stores, you will see they’re loaded to the tits with cars and they are paying for space off site for all the other cars they can’t hold on site. Side note to this: there was recently a large fire for one of these off site lots that caused a ton of damage to inventory. Projected at a $90 million loss for the three top dogs but HTZ got hit hardest. Most people think they’re backed by insurance but they’re self-insured, so this is a huge loss on top of the missed revenue. 

On top of all of this bad news, HTZ isn’t even a strong company to begin with. 

I don’t see these companies weathering this storm without a bailout, but what do I know I’m retarded.

**Not necessarily.** In reality Hertz may have set in a motion a series of events that could just let it cruise out of bankruptcy and soar way above the current share price.

And this is how. According to Bloomberg:

***"" Several sets of unsecured Hertz bonds soared after the ruling, with the 5.5% notes due 2024 jumping almost 13 cents on the dollar to 48.5 cents -- their best level in almost two months ""***

So basically, by getting permission to sell its bankrupt shares to raise cash, Hertz has become ***considerably more attractive to future lenders since HTZ now has a massive potential source of cash flow /collateral created out of thin air.***

So this is what happens. When a company's borrowing costs (bond yields) **decrease**, its share price **increases** as a general rule. So to put it into perspective:

HTZ shares rally---&gt; borrowing costs decrease ---&gt;HTZ shares rally as a result ----&gt; borrow costs decrease-----&gt;repeat and recycle. **In WSB terms, Hertz can now have future lenders hold the bags while using the collective autism of Robinhood as their collateral.**

When HTZ was above $5.00 the bond markets (lenders) gave no fucks. HTZ is bankrupt, they said, they're not allowed to issue shares anyway, they said, it's against the rules and it's never been done before. **Well guess what? The courts just decided they can. Hertz keeps on getting away with it**

And so on and so forth. Could all shareholders be wiped out? Yes, there's a decent possibility. But if Hertz can somehow take advantage of both the equity and bond markets, it could conceivably just roll over its debt, get out of bankruptcy relatively scott free and ***become a much more efficient business in the aftermath. This has never been done before. We are in uncharted territory.***

Good luck, fellow autists.",wallstreetbets,Why the Hertz rally suddenly makes perfect sense. HTZ 11c September,2020-06-13

Basically they skip out on an interest payment on bonds and then file for Chapter 11. Overall their business seems like the biggest impact was driven by COVID and ensuing drop in demand, impacted also by the oil price war and just couldn't hang on long enough.

Interesting point to me is that it looks like they're not closing the place and selling off the assets to pay their creditors. It looks like they're just transferring ownership of the company to the creditors and keeping the company trading.

I can't imagine their creditors would be willing to be bought off using stocks in a company that they thought was worthless, so looks to me like there could be a turnaround on the horizon for XOG.",wallstreetbets,Is XOG the new HTZ,2020-06-17
